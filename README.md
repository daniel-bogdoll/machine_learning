# Overview
Three tiers of machine learning regularly recognized today:
### Supervised Machine Learning
Studying labeled data, these techniques can extend patterns to unlabeled data.
Classification: Categorial Outcomes
Regression: Numeric Outcomes
Deep learning can be used within supervised machine learning to create techniques that are better at image recognition or identifying when a movie was created based on the video footage.

### Unsupervised Machine Learning
By learning patterns even when data do not have labels, these techniques can group items together that are likely to be similar.

### Reinforcement Machine Learning
By rewarding actions, these techniques focus on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).

# Supervised Learning
## Linear Regression
### Summary
- Gradient descent as a method to optimize your linear models.
- Multiple Linear Regression as a technique for when you are comparing more than two variables.
- Polynomial Regression for relationships between variables that aren't linear.
- Regularization as a technique to assure that your models will not only fit to the data available, but also extend to new situations.
### Outlook
In this lesson, you were predicting quantitative values. Predicting quantitative values is often just considered a Regression problem. In the next lesson, you will be introduced to predicting a category, which is called a Classification problem.
