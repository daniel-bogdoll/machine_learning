# Overview
Three tiers of machine learning regularly recognized today:
### Supervised Machine Learning
Studying labeled data, these techniques can extend patterns to unlabeled data.
Classification: Categorial Outcomes
Regression: Numeric Outcomes
Deep learning can be used within supervised machine learning to create techniques that are better at image recognition or identifying when a movie was created based on the video footage.

### Unsupervised Machine Learning
By learning patterns even when data do not have labels, these techniques can group items together that are likely to be similar.

### Reinforcement Machine Learning
By rewarding actions, these techniques focus on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).
