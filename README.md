# Supervised Learning
## Linear Regression: Concepts
### Summary
- Gradient descent as a method to optimize your linear models.
- Multiple Linear Regression as a technique for when you are comparing more than two variables.
- Polynomial Regression for relationships between variables that aren't linear.
- Regularization as a technique to assure that your models will not only fit to the data available, but also extend to new situations.
### Outro
In this lesson, you were predicting quantitative values. Predicting quantitative values is often just considered a Regression problem. In the next lesson, you will be introduced to predicting a category, which is called a Classification problem.
