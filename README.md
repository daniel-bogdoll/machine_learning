# Udacity Machine Learning

This repository covers my participation in the courses
- [Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning-with-tensorflow-nanodegree--nd230) and
- [Coursera Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning)

## Overview
The courses cover the tiers of machine learning regularly recognized today:
### Supervised Learning
Studying labeled data, these techniques can extend patterns to unlabeled data.
Classification: Categorial Outcomes
Regression: Numeric Outcomes
Deep learning can be used within supervised machine learning to create techniques that are better at image recognition or identifying when a movie was created based on the video footage.

### Unsupervised Learning
By learning patterns even when data do not have labels, these techniques can group items together that are likely to be similar.

### Reinforcement Learning
By rewarding actions, these techniques focus on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).
